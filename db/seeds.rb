# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# userworkout = UserWorkout.create!(user_id: 1109, workout_id: 100, weight: 400, reps: 1 )
# workout = Workout.create!(name: "Front Squat", workout_type: "Strength" )
workout = Workout.create!(name: "Back Squat", workout_type: "Strength")
